## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple botnet simulation using Python. The bots can connect to a control server and execute commands, such as performing a UDP flood attack.

## Features

- **UDP Flood Attack**: Execute a UDP flood attack on a specified target.
- **Command-Control Server**: Manage bots and send commands from a central server.
- **Threaded Bot Handling**: Each bot runs on a separate thread for efficient handling.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `socket` library
- `threading` library

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/botnet-simulation.git
    cd botnet-simulation
    ```

2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.

## Usage

### Running the Command-Control Server

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the server script:
    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```

### Running a Bot

1. Open a new terminal for each bot instance.
2. Run the bot script:
    ```bash
    python bot.py
    ```

### Executing Commands

- To execute a UDP flood attack, use the following command format:
    ```plaintext
    udp_flood <target_ip> <target_port> <duration>
    ```

- To terminate a bot connection, use:
    ```plaintext
    exit
    ```

### Important Note

**Disclaimer:** This project is for educational and research purposes only. The use of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks is illegal and unethical. Always ensure that you have explicit permission from the target network before conducting any form of network stress testing or simulation. Misuse of this tool can result in legal consequences. Always adhere to applicable laws and regulations.
